# 11 - Create a VM with the CLI

In this walkthrough, we will install the Azure CLI locally, create a resource group and virtual machine, use the Cloud Shell, and review Azure Advisor recommendations. 

**Note**: The following steps are based on a Windows installation, however they could also be followed on a Mac or Linux computer. However, there are [specific installation steps for each environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

# Task 1: Install the CLI locally

In this task, we will install the Azure CLI on your local machine. 

1. Open a browser window and browse to the location of [Azure CLI msi](https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows) and, when prompted, click **Run**. It will take a minute for the files to download.

2. In the Microsoft Azure CLI Setup wizard, click the checkbox **I accept the terms in the license agreement** and then click **Install**.

3. If prompted, in the **User Account Control** dialog box, confirm that the installation can make changes to your device. 

4. Once the installation is complete, click **Finish**.

    **Note:** The Azure CLI can be run from Bash shell in Linux or macOS, or it can be run from the Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows. 

# Task 2: Create a resource group and a virtual machine

1. On your local machine, open a **Command Prompt** as administrator. If prompted, in the **User Account Control** dialog box, confirm to allow changes to your device.

    **Note**: You can run the Azure CLI from a PowerShell session rather than from the Windows Command Prompt. Running the CLI from PowerShell has some advantages such as additional tab completion features.

2. Login to your Azure subscription. When prompted, provide the credentials of the account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab and wait until you are successfully logged in. 

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

3. Verify your installation by running the version check command and ensuring it runs successfully. A warning message about being unable to check for the latest updates, is okay. 

    ```cli
    az --version
    ```

4. Create a new resource group.

    ```cli
    az group create --name myRGCLI --location EastUS
    ```

5. Verify the resource group was created.

    ```cli
    az group list --output table
    ```

6. Create a new virtual machine. Make sure that each line except for the last one is followed by the caret (`^`) character. If you type the whole command on the same line, do not use any backslash characters. 

    ```cli
    az vm create ^
    --name myVMCLI ^
    --resource-group myRGCLI ^
    --image UbuntuLTS ^
    --location EastUS ^
    --admin-username azureuser ^
    --admin-password Pa$$w0rd1234
    ```

    **Note**: If you are using a Linux or macOS computer (or running the command via CloudShell), replace the caret (`^`) character with backslash (`\`)
    
    **Note**: The command will take 2 to 3 minutes to complete. The command will create a virtual machine and various resources associated with it such as storage, networking and security resources. Do not continue to the next step until the virtual machine deployment is complete. 

7. When the command finishes running, in the browser window, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

8. Search for **Virtual machines** and verify that **myVMCLI** is running.

9. Close your local CLI session. 

# Task 3: Execute commmands in the Cloud Shell

In this task, we will practice executing CLI commands from the Cloud Shell. 

1. From the portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the *Azure Cloud Shell icon* in the top right of the Azure Portal.

    ![Screenshot of Azure Portal Azure Cloud Shell icon.](../images/1102.png)

2. If you have previously used the Cloud Shell skip ahead to Step 5. 

3. When prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **Bash**. 

4. When prompted, click **Create storage**, and wait for the Azure Cloud Shell to initialize. 

5. Ensure **Bash** is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu of the Cloud Shell pane.

    **Note:** You do not need to login when using Cloud Shell

6. Retrieve information about the virtual machine you provisioned, including name, resource group, location, and status. Notice the PowerState is **running**.

    ```cli
    az vm show --resource-group myRGCLI --name myVMCLI --show-details --output table 
    ```

7. Stop the virtual machine. Notice the message that billing continues until the virtual machine is deallocated. 

    ```cli
    az vm stop --resource-group myRGCLI --name myVMCLI
    ```

8. Verify your virtual machine status. The PowerState should now be **stopped**.

    ```cli
    az vm show --resource-group myRGCLI --name myVMCLI --show-details --output table 
    ```

# Task 4: Review Azure Advisor Recommendations

In this task, we will review Azure Advisor recommendations.

   **Note:** If you have completed the previous lab (Create a VM with PowerShell), then you have already performed this task. 

1. From the **All services** blade, search for and select **Advisor**. 

2. On the **Advisor** blade, select **Overview**. Notice recommendations are grouped by High Availability, Security, Performance, and Cost. 

    ![Screenshot of the Advisor Overview page. ](../images/1103.png)

3. Select **All recommendations** and take time to view each recommendation and suggested actions. 

    **Note:** Depending on your resources, your recommendations will be different. 

    ![Screenshot of the Advisor All recommendations page. ](../images/1104.png)

4. Notice that you can download the recommendations as a CSV or PDF file. 

5. Notice that you can create alerts. 

6. If you have time, continue to experiment with Azure PowerShell. 

Congratulations! You have installed PowerShell on your local machine, created a virtual machine using PowerShell, practiced with PowerShell commands, and viewed Advisor recommendations.

**Note**: To avoid additional costs, you can remove this resource group. Search for resource groups, click your resource group, and then click **Delete resource group**. Verify the name of the resource group and then click **Delete**. Monitor the **Notifications** to see how the delete is proceeding.
