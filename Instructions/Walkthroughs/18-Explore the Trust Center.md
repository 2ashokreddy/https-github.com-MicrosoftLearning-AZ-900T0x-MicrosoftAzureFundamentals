# 18 - Explore Microsoft Compliance Offerings (5 min)

In this walkthrough, we will access Compliance Offerings, the Service Trust Portal (STP), and Compliance Manager. 

# Task 1: Access Microsoft Compliance Offerings

1. Open a new browser window. In the address bar, replace the default text with T https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-home

2. On the Compliance page, notice the offerings are grouped into **Global**, **US Government**, **Industry**, and **Regional**.

3. In the **Global** group, click **ISO 27001**. Scroll through the information provided. Scrolling down on the page will take you to a section **Compliance offerings specifically for Azure**

    **Note:** The ISO 27001 Information Security Management Standards page is typical of the type of complaince information we provide.


# Task 2: Access the Service Trust Portal (STP)

1. Open a new browser window. In the address bar, replace the default text with T https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/.

2. Notice the **Audit Reports** section. In this section are independent audit reports for different Microsoft's Cloud services. If you want to try the Compliance Manager you will need to login.

3. It may take a couple of minutes for all the audits to load. You will need to login to your Microsoft account to view specific reports.


# Task 3: Access the Compliance Manager via the Service Trust Portal

The Compliance Manager makes it easy to perform risk assessments of Microsoft's cloud services. Use Compliance Manager to manage your organization's compliance activities from implementation to reporting. 

1. If your browser window is still open from Task 2, proceed to Step 2. Otherwise, open a new browser window, and paste T https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/Documents/TrustDocuments.  

2. Scroll down to **Audit Reports**. Take a look around.

Congratulations! In this walkthrough, you accessed the Trust Center, Service Trust Portal (STP), and Compliance Manager.
